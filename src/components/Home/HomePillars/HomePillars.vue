          By default, Flux is designed with new patterns that inspire more
          meaningful and healthy interactions. While our
          tools are free from many extractive norms, we also respect people's
          agency to shape their community culture however they want.

        <p class="homePillars__pillar--body">
          Flux is powered by web3 technologies, Holochain and AD4M. This means
          all your communication is p2p and decentralized, protecting you from
          spying, ads, censorship, and much more. You own both your data and
          experience.

        <p class="homePillars__pillar--body">
          All of the software we build is open source and eventually, we will
          have distributed governance tools that enable our community to drive
          the development of this social utility moving forward.
