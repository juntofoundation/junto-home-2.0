          Privacy is at the very heart of the Junto Foundation, Inc. (“Junto,” “we,” “our,” or “us”).
          As a social media company founded in the spirit of authenticity, privacy represents a fundamental
          tenet of our belief system and an essential part of the very backbone upon which our Services stand.
          Therefore, we want you as a visitor to our Application (“App”) and user of our apps, features and software
          (collectively, “Services”) to feel confident in using our stuff provisions and fully understand the expectations
          around surrounding your privacy.

        <p class="privacyPolicyHeader__section--body">
          We're dedicated to consumer privacy rights and thus offer our users a comprehensive Privacy Policy,
          written in plain language and with the intent of helping you understand what information we collect,
          why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information. When we collect
          your information, we are subject to various laws in the United States and the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)
          which applies across the European Union (including in the United Kingdom), and we are responsible as the “controller” of that
          personal information for the purposes of those laws.
