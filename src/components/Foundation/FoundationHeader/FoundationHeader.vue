        <p class="foundationHeader__subtitle"> Junto is a nonprofit organization registered
            in New York. This means there are no investors or shareholders that 'own' a stake 
            in Junto and can alter the direction of it moving forward. We wanted to set measures
            early on that will ensure the integrity of this organization is sustainable long term.
