        <h2 class="foundationHeader__title">Support the Junto Foundation</h2>
        <p class="foundationHeader__subtitle"> Junto is a nonprofit organization registered
            in New York. This means there are no investors or shareholders that 'own' a stake 
            in Junto and can alter the direction of it moving forward. We are setting measures 
            early on that will ensure the integrity of this organization is sustainable long term.
